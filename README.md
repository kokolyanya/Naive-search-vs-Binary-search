# Naive-search-vs-Binary-search
#we want to prove that binary search is faster than naive search
#naive search: scan entire list and ask if its equals to the target
#binary search: scan at the half of the list and ask if its equals to the target,
#or smaller or bigger, and continue in the half of the list where the target is
#we need to sort the list for the binary search
